# life-expectancy-gdp

Gross Domestic Product (or simply GDP), is an offical measure that sums everything produced by a country. Learning how this changed over time is a reliable way of determine how wealthy a country has been along the years.

In this analysis an investigation of how GDP and life expectancy of Chile, Mexico, Germany, USA, China and Zimbabwe changed between 2000 and 2015 is carried out. A possible correlation between these two indicators, for each country, is also evaluated and quantified through basic linear regression.
